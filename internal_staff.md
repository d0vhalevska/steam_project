# Standups

## 12/01/2022
- take a week as a mean to summarize data
- take a look at genres 
- try back seat programming / work in pairs 
- for next meeting: have some results already. Try make a few plots (not necessarily pretty) : e.g. what genres are the most popular? Avarage time aspects etc. 
Later we can look what influences those patterns. Soooo plots, plots, plots. Next week we will take a look at them and discuss.

## Zoom 19/01/2022
1) sort genres by mean player count
2) plot: progression over time and if it is different for every genres; do -> put years on axes and turn it in to a line plot. Then we can see clear increase in 2020. Line plot can be too messy. Look at it and maybe separate.  
Create subsets like: plot with game with bump, another plot with no changes and  plot with less players in 2020. 
3) work with the results we have and do progress presentation

Next meeting
22.01 Saturday: 13:00 (around 3-4 h)
25.01 Tuesday: 20:00 to rehearse

Joris's Feedback: However, I feel that the focus on the presentation is too much on your process, experiences, etc. While I like the improvement between your "ugly" plot (slide 6) and the improved version, it does not add much to the story that you should be telling. Instead, the focus should be on the results: what should I learn from your presentation, about video games? This lack of focus on results was more general, also when presenting the trends in tags: as an audience, I can get very little from those plots (slides 8-9).
Instead, you should focus more on the results that you have: there are some major results that you mentioned (the most popular genres are "free to play" and "MMO"), but there isn't a slide that emphasizes that -- instead it's buried in the visualisation on slide 8. 
Also, I'm not convinced that going to look at tags will be very productive now; it's a large variable space that would require some clustering etc, which is technically ambitious. Instead, I think you have interesting results re:genres, and could quite easily extend to look at price as an influence.
More generally, I'm really missing a specific data question. What, exactly, do you need to see in the data, to be able to answer your research question? Without this, you're a bit adrift, and likely to explore all kinds of analyses that may or may not be productive. Formulate some specific data questions, e.g. "Which genres had highest average player counts?" "Does this change over time?", and make one visualisation per data question, that clearly answers that data question.
    1. Popularity of genres (top 10 maybe)
    2. Getting/losing/staying popular (change a smaller scale on y-axis)
    3. Player count and price on the same graph (discount impacts player count?)

### DATA QUESTIONS
-> formulate clear data question and answer them. That leads us to clear story.
1) What are the genres with top 10 amounts of players? (Horizontal sorted bar plot) 
We take these top 10 and do next plots/results only with them.
Explain in presentation/report how did we choose those 10 -> players count

2)How does popularity of genres change during the last year (2020)?
-> Over the last year how do genres change for the top 10 amount of players

3)How is price related to popularity?
-> Scatter plot  with axes : price and player count (over years)
->Each dot in scatter plot = individual game. So maybe set alpha value on 0.4 e.g.

4) Is players count greater during the discount period than before discount?

### RESEARCH QUESTION
How we answer our research question:
So to make your game is successful, you should choose between these top 10 genres...; Set the price in-between this range/options; Make a discount at a certain period of time or discount doesn't change anything. 

### LIMITATIONS
Talk about our limitations (what is not in our data, so we don't know the influence or state of it):
-very wide genres (like multiple player etc.)
-stabilities
-changes
-amount of games in genres
-is there any subscriptions in "free "games

### FINAL PRESENTATION https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YCam_insIlOOAvcVj5VgddwN_T_6QmEDFpncIqF4730/edit?usp=sharing
In final presentation concentrate more on Introduction and Results, less on Methods.

So the structure can be: 
1. Introduction
2. research question
3. Data questions: 
- result #1 & short method for this. (E.g. we plot these 10 genres ... bla bla")
- So now we concentrate on these 10 genres... Result #2 & method for this...
4. So we can answer our research question like this....

### NOTES
- in Results we do not explain "why". In results we say: "from the data we see that..."
- in Discussion we can interpret the results (e.g. about free games and the facts that there can be subscriptions etc.)
